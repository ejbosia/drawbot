# drawbot
This repository works with the "drawbot" project, which is a simple cartesian drawing robot. The program takes in binary images and "fills" them using different fill techniques. An eventual goal is to branch into more generic images, including color.

 - Python: code used to testing

**It is still in progress**

Right now, the goal is to implement Connected Fermat Spirals from my other repository.
