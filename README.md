# drawbot
This repository works with the "drawbot" project, which is a simple cartesian drawing robot. The program takes binary images and "fills" them using different fill techniques. A goal is to branch into more generic images.

 - Python: code used to testing
 - C++: code used to improve performance

## Fill Techniques
Rectilinear fill
