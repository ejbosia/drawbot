# drawbot
This repository works with the "drawbot" project, which is a simple cartesian drawing robot. The program takes binary images and "fills" them using different fill techniques. A goal is to branch into more generic images.

## Fill Techniques
Rectilinear fill --> done
Spiral fill --> done
CFS fill --> in progress
